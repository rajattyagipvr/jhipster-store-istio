# JHipster-generated Kubernetes Knative configuration

## Preparation

- Knative depends on Istio. In order to use the manifests generated by k8s-knative generator, you should have istio and kntaive installed
  in the cluster. Follow [this link](https://knative.dev/docs/install/) for instructions.

- You will need to push your image(s) to a registry. If you have not done so, use the following commands to tag and push the images:

```
    $ docker image tag store 702769831180.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/702769831180/store/store
$ docker push 702769831180.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/702769831180/store/store
    $ docker image tag invoice 702769831180.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/702769831180/store/invoice
$ docker push 702769831180.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/702769831180/store/invoice
    $ docker image tag notification 702769831180.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/702769831180/store/notification
$ docker push 702769831180.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/702769831180/store/notification
    $ docker image tag product 702769831180.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/702769831180/store/product
$ docker push 702769831180.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/702769831180/store/product
```

- This generator uses k8s generator for most of the part, except the core microservices apps that are (k)native.

## Deployment

You can deploy all your apps by running the below terminal command:

For Kubernetes specific more information, refer to the `kubernetes` sub-generator Readme instructions.
